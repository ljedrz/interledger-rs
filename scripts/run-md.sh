# This script parses and executes code blocks found in Markdown files.
# In addition to parsing code found between ```bash ... ```,
# it also parses code from special HTML comments that start with <!--!
# This allows us to hide certain commands from view in the rendered
# Markdown file but run them when the whole file is executed.
# This is largely intended for commands that make the output more readable
